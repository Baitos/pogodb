This is a Pokemon Go Database I'm working on for C++ Practice. You can view, add, remove, or modify gold gyms, and (eventually) will be able to track XL Candy on mons. I think everything is working fine but I'm still screwing around with it. Make sure the exe and the .txt files are in the same folder or the program won't run. Thanks.


FORMAT: Name, Location, Y/N, Number 

Name: Gym Name

Location: Gym Location (by City/Town but could technically be anything)

Number: The position in your list (this is my 100th gold gym!)

Y/N: Whether or not the gym still exists

With the Add Gyms Function, Name and Location must be included but Number and/or Existence can be omitted and the program will auto-fill those values for you (-1, Y respectively)
